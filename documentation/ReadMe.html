<p>Samedi is a little app to load audio samples into up to 8 pads and assign them to MIDI notes. The samples can then be played back by pressing the set key on your MIDI keyboard. Alternatively Samedi also reacts to the number keys on your computer keyboard.<br />
If you suffer from high latency, see the tip on <a href="#latency">Latency</a> below.</p>

<a id="usage" name="usage">Usage</a></h2>

<p>Using Samedi should be pretty self-explaining.<br />
You can load any audio file by clicking the <span class="button">&lt;click to load a sample&gt;</span> button of an empty pad. That button label turns into the loaded file name, click it to load another sample. The pads also accept drag'n'dropped audio files.</p>

<p>All samples of the 8 pads can be saved as so-called 'Ensembles' from the <span class="menu">Ensemble</span> menu. Ensembles can also be loaded via drag'n'drop.<br />
Note: These ensembles don't contain the actual sample files, just their location on the harddisk. If you move or rename those files, Samedi won't find them anymore.</p>

<p>Each tab has three buttons to set a playback mode: <span class="button">M</span> to mute the pad, <span class="button">S</span> for solo playback (all other pads get muted), and <span class="button">∞</span> to play the loaded sample in a loop.</p>

<p>A pad's sample is played back either by clicking its <span class="button">⯈</span> button, pressing the pad's number on the computer keyboard (<span class="key">1</span> to <span class="key">8</span>), or hitting the set MIDI note on your keyboard.<br />
You can enter the MIDI note in the text box on the left, or detect the pressed key after clicking the narrow button beside it.</p>

<p>The menu <span class="menu">MIDI in</span> shows all detected MIDI producers in the system. If there are more than one, you can choose the ones that Samedi will listen to.</p>

<p>To empty a pad, click the <span class="button">⏏</span> button at the far right. You can reset all pads at once with <span class="menu">Clear all pads</span> from the <span class="menu">Ensemble</span> menu.</p>

<a id="latency" name="latency">La…tency</a></h2>

<p>If you experience relatively long delays between hitting a key and hearing a sound, your sound driver's buffers may be too large. Until Haiku allows tweaking those settings in the <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/preferences/media.html">Media preferences</a>, you can edit a text settings file.<br />
There are examples for most common chipsets:<br />
<a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/plain/src/add-ons/kernel/drivers/audio/hda/hda.settings">hda.settings</a>, <a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/plain/src/add-ons/kernel/drivers/audio/ac97/auich/auich.settings">auich.settings</a>, <a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/plain/src/add-ons/kernel/drivers/audio/ac97/es1370/es1370.settings">es1370.settings</a>, <a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/plain/src/add-ons/kernel/drivers/audio/echo/echo.settings">echo.settings</a>, <a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/plain/src/add-ons/kernel/drivers/audio/emuxki/emuxki.settings">emuxki.settings</a>, and <a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/plain/src/add-ons/kernel/drivers/audio/ice1712/ice1712.settings">ice1712.settings</a>.</p>

<p>To find which driver settings file you need, open Terminal and enter "<tt>listimage | grep /dev/audio</tt>" - the output should give you a hint. 
Then download the right settings file and put it into <tt>/boot/home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/</tt> and open it for editing.</p>

<p>Large buffers allow for trouble-free, continuous playback with low ressources even in a taxed system, but they increase the time the sound starts playing. When setting those buffers, you'll have to compromise to find values that fit your needs. For the HDA chipset, for example, Pete Goodeve found that "<i>for real time audio, a buffer of 1024 frames at 192000 should be good (latency <15ms), but you will need more buffers if they're small.</i>".<br />
So, remove the commenting "#" of those lines and try with:</p>
<pre>
play_buffer_frames	1024
play_buffer_count	4
</pre>
<p>The settings files of other chipsets may use different keywords, but generally work similarly.</p>
<p>To try out your new settings, click on <span class="button">Restart media services</span> of the "Audio settings" of the Media preferences. You'll have to restart Samedi as well.</p>

<a id="tips" name="tips">Tips &amp; Tricks</a></h2>
<p>The tip how to decrease latency above is probably the most vital. Here are a few more less spectacular ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Haiku's sound system (at least the part currently used by Samedi) appears to sometimes have issues with very short audio files. Those appear to play part a of the start of the sample at the end as well. Or add some noise to the end. Not ideal in case of short drum samples, for example<br />
In this case, it may help to add a few seconds of silence to the end of the sample with an audio editor. Oh bother, I know…</p></li>
<li><p>More than one instance of Samedi can run simultaneously, if you need more than 8 pads.</p></li>
<li><p>More than one pad can react to the same MIDI note, in case you want to play back several samples with hitting a single key.</p></li>
<li><p>You can select more than one device from the <span class="menu">MIDI in</span> menu as sources for MIDI notes.</p></li>
</ul>
