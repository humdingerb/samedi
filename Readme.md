Samedi is a little app to load audio samples into up to 8 pads and assign them to MIDI notes. The samples can then be played back by pressing the set key on your MIDI keyboard. Alternatively Samedi also reacts to the number keys on your computer keyboard.

For more information, please see the [Samedi help file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/humdingerb/samedi/master/documentation/ReadMe.html).
